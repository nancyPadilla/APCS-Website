			<p>This is my older sister's dog. Her name is Bambi but she doesn't know that
			because we always call her chispa, which is spanish for spark. She looks cute, 
			but she is very agressive. She is a very soft dog and enjoys eating fruit and
		    meat, but not veggies. She like being pet but not having air in her face. 
		    She enjoys long naps and long walks but since she barks at everyone, she doesn't go out
			 everyday. She has a chicken toy that squeaks but no one is allowed to touch it.
			 When she gets angry, she hides under the couch and likes to take in heat next
			 to the heater.</p>
