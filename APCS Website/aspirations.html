			<h1> Sense of Accomplishment</h1>
			<p>Sence of Accomplishment is one of the 8 Conditions for student success that WHS
			has adopted. Sence f accomplishment is the feeling you get when you have worked
			so hard on a project, all on your own, and then you finally turn it in. It feels
			like a small weight has lifted off your shoulders and you can finally take a good 
			nap. I feel pretty accomplished making this website on my own.<p>
