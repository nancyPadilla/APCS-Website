			<h1> Agricultural Drones</h1>
			<hr>
			<img src="images/dronw1.png" align="right">
			Agricultural Drones ar a new form of technology that applies to farming and helps
			increase the production of crops and monitor the growth of the crops.
			On some drones, one can create a path for the drone to take in order for it to
			cover the necessary area. AS the drone flies, it uses its Gps sensor and built-in
			camera to determine where photos need to be taken. This new tech also allows 
			farmers to take clearer and richer pictures of the crops.<br> 
			Businesses believe
			the overall drone market will be greater than 12billion dollars by 2021. The
			agricultural drone market, in specific, is expected to surpass $1 billion 
			dollars by 2024 as predicted by Global Market Insights.
